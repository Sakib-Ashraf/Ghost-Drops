There are many important steps along the way, but one of the most crucial phases for ensuring quality is the last few weeks before harvest and the next few weeks following harvest. During this time, four main processes occur – flushing, curing, trimming, and drying. In this article we will look at each of these 4 processes and explain how they affect the quality of the end product. Ghost Drops ensures that all our micro-cultivator partners grow and finish each plant with care and expertise. <\/p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>Flushing<\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>Flushing cannabis is a controversial topic among some growers. Some think that the efficacy of flushing is a myth while others think it’s a critical process that creates the best end product for smoking and vaporizing. The logic is that you should stop feeding your plants nutrients a few weeks before harvest, thereby encouraging the plant to use the non-assimilated salts and nutrients remaining in the plant. This is supposed to result in a cleaner, smoother smoke with lighter, white ash. Having too much remaining nutrients in the end product is supposed to result in a harsher smoke and darker ash. It is important to remember that this is just one theory and the validity of these claims are contested by certain growers. <\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>Drying <\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>Once the plant is fully mature and harvested, the drying, trimming, and curing process begins. Drying cannabis properly improves and maintains the flavour and potency of the plant. Drying is just as important as the growing process. Bad drying protocol can ruin even the best batch of cannabis. Drying reduces the water content of the plant which results in a higher quality, smoother smoke. Different growers have different methods of drying but generally hang-drying in a climate-controlled room is preferable. <\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>Trimming <\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>After the plant has been harvested and fully dried, it is time to trim the excess leaf off the buds. Fan leaves, trim leaves surrounding the buds and extraneous material are removed with scissors. What’s left is a well-manicured bud (almost) ready for consumption.  <\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>Curing<\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>Curing occurs after flushing, drying, and trimming is complete. Curing is one of the most important aspects of producing premium quality cannabis but is often overlooked by inexperienced growers. You can think about curing cannabis like aging a fine wine. Curing cannabis slowly removes further moisture from the plant under controlled environmental conditions. The curing process encourages the degradation of byproducts such as sugars, chlorophyl and starches – which serve as breeding grounds for mold and mildew. Curing helps to eliminate the byproducts from your cannabis, protecting your plants from bacteria and resulting in a smoother smoke. A low, slow cure can help preserve terpenes and bring out the full flavour profile of the plant. Curing at low temperatures also allows growers to maintain the potency and THC percentage of their finished harvests.<\/p>\n\n    <p>The finishing phase is just as important as all of the time spent growing the plant itself. All of Ghost Drops’ cannabis is grown by skilled craft micro-cultivators using tried and true growth methods and mediums. You can be sure that all of Ghost Drops indoor premium flower products are expertly flushed, dried, trimmed and cured.\n<\/p>",

          "content": "<br><div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h6>Ghost Guide: How to Judge the Quality of Cannabis<\/h6>\n<\/div>\n<p>There are four main categories that the Ghost Drops team uses to assess the quality of weed when deciding which new strains we are going to drop. Those categories are Appearance, Burn, Nose and Strength with a few different factors under each. <\/p>\n<br>\n    <p><b>Appearance<\/b> encompasses both the quality of the bud structure and the readiness of the flower.<\/p>\n    <p> <b>a.\tBud Structure: <\/b>   the structure (size and shape) of a particular bud is typically linked to the cultivar’s genetics. Sativa-dominant cultivars are more associated with a long, thin structure. Indica strains frequently produce much larger, tight, dense buds. To a certain degree, bud structure is a matter of personal preference. However, the Ghost Drops team uses this as a metric to evaluate if the bud is living up to its genetic expression, how the bud was grown and the overall quality of the trim and finish visually. <\/p>\n\n<p> <b>b.\tReadiness of the flower: <\/b>   this refers to how “ripe” the trichomes on the plant are and how fully developed and finished the bud is. Premium flower should feature visible, milky-white trichomes – which indicates the plant has been grown to full maturity. Buds should be fully formed and not too “larfy” (wispy, fluffy buds that didn’t reach their full potential). <\/p>\n<p><b>Burn <\/b> is assessed while smoking the bud and encompasses smoothness of smoke, flavour conversion, ash colour and structure, oil accumulation and the presence of a resin ring.<\/p>\n<p> <b>a.\tSmoothness:<\/b>   cannabis should be pleasant and easy to smoke. Vapour or smoke should be able to be inhaled deep in the lungs without causing intense coughing. Bud should be potent and hit hard, but it shouldn’t be harsh in any way. After smoking, your throat and lungs shouldn’t hurt. An important part of assessing cannabis quality is looking at how smooth and enjoyable the smoking experience is.  <\/p>\n\n<p> <b>b.\tFlavour Conversion: <\/b>  does the strain taste how it smells? Some cannabis cultivars have an amazing aroma with zero or a bad taste, and vice versa. Does the aroma translate into the flavour when smoking? High quality cannabis will have a similar, pleasant flavour and pleasant aroma.   <\/p>\n\n<p> <b>c.\tAsh Colour and Structure: <\/b>  there is some debate around the importance of ash colour when it comes to cannabis quality. The traditional belief is that white ash signifies that cannabis has been flushed, cured, and finished properly while black, darker ash indicates the opposite. Ash colour is influenced by growing methods, genetics and more. However, generally, ash that is stable and light\/white is preferable to darker, inconsistent ash.   <\/p>\n\n<p> <b>d.\tOil Accumulation \/ Resin Ring:  <\/b>  if your cannabis is trichome-dense and high quality, it will frequently lead to oil accumulation near the end of the joint where it is burning. This resin naturally forms a circle around the joint, hence why it is called a “resin ring”. The presence of a resin ring indicates potency of the plant. Look for a wet, drippy resin ring as a positive indicator of cannabis quality.  <\/p>\n\n<p><b>Nose <\/b> is judging the aroma of the plant and includes the genetic expression of the phenotype and the overall pungency.<\/p>\n<p> <b>a.\tGenetic Expression:   <\/b> certain genetic lineages of cannabis are associated with certain flavours and aromas. If it is named “haze”, does it smell like a haze? If it has kush in the name– does it smell like a kush? If it has Gelato, Wedding Cake or GSC in its lineage – does it smell like a dessert strain? How accurate is the aromatic profile to its genetic parents and lineage? Bud that is incredibly accurate to its cultivar name is preferable to bud that is not. <\/p>\n\n<p> <b>b.\tPungency:  <\/b> how loud is the aroma overall? When you crack the jar, does it fill up the room with its scent? Or do you have to break open the buds and get up close to get a good sense of the smell? Cannabis that is flavourful and aromatic is preferable to cannabis that is more subtle and odourless. Pungency is typically reflected by overall terpene content. <\/p>\n\n<p><b>Strength<\/b> assesses the potency and the overall effect that the cannabis plant produces after it is smoked. <\/p>\n<p> <b>a.\tPotency<\/b> Plainly, how strong is the weed? Do you feel the effects when you consume it? Potency is sometimes (but not exclusively) linked to the presence of THC and the percentage of cannabinoids found in a particular lot. <\/p>\n\n<p> <b>b.\tOverall Effect <\/b> How enjoyable are the felt effects after consuming the cultivar? Do you feel good? Are there any negative side effects such as headaches or dry mouth? How enjoyable is the high in your personal opinion? Because the effects of cannabis are so subjective, both potency and overall effect will vary widely from person to person.  <\/p>\n\n<p> When the Ghost Drops team tests out new product, each of these factors is judged with a x\/10 score. All these scores add up to a x\/100 score – easily allowing you to convert the final score into a percentage. <\/p>\n\n\n<p> How do you judge the quality of cannabis?

          "content": "<br><div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h6>Ghost Guide: Terpenes<\/h6>\n<\/div>\n<p>Since legalization in Canada, there has been too much of a focus on THC percentages. Prior to legal labelling requirements, consumers largely bought cannabis based off its appearance, aroma and flavour. The chemical compounds that make up the aromatic composition of a particular cannabis cultivar are known as terpenes. These terpenes are also believed to contribute to the overall experience and effects felt when cannabis is consumed.<\/p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>What are Terpenes?<\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>The flavour and aroma of any cannabis strain is dictated by the terpene profile that the plant expresses. Terpenes are naturally occurring chemical compounds that are found in a variety of different plant species, including cannabis. Terpenes are what makes each cultivar unique and are typically associated strictly with the gustatorial sensations of marijuana. However, the entourage effect theory presents that terpenes, along with cannabinoids and other plant molecules, interact together to determine the felt effects when a particular cultivar is consumed. <\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>What are the benefits of Terpenes? What is the link between flavour and effects?<\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>Terpenes are the reason your bud smells and tastes so good. Terpenes provide the delicious and unique smells and flavours that cannabis provides. Terpenes, along with cannabinoids and other molecules, may also be linked to the “high” that you experience after consuming. <br>\nThe link between flavour and effects is complex and multi-layered. To help illustrate this point, imagine eating a lemon. When you consume a refreshing, sour, citrusy fruit – it results in an immediate boost of energy and increase in alertness. Similarly, when you consume a cultivar high in limonene and low in other specific terpenes, an analogous effect may be felt. The relationship between taste\/flavour\/aroma and felt experience is well documented in other areas of life – food, drink, nature, etc. Cannabis is no exception. When you consume cultivars that smell good, taste good and appeal to your personal senses, you are more likely to have a positive experience. Identifying which terpenes and which terpene profiles are associated with desired flavours and effects can help cannabis consumers select better product options for themselves. \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>What are the most common Terpenes found in cannabis? <\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>Some terpenes are more prevalent than others. Myrcene is known as the most common terpene and when present, is usually one of the most dominant terpenes in a select cultivar’s profile. Limonene (also found in lemons), Pinene (found in pine trees) Linalool (found in lavender) and Humulene (found in hops) are other common terpenoids.  <\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>What do terpene percentages mean? <\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>Just like cannabinoids (THC and CBD), terpene content can also be expressed in percentages. Terpene percentages are usually expressed in the total amount of terpene content in a particular strain. For example, the latest batch of First Class Funk could be testing at 4.5% terpenes total. Within that total 4.5%, there will be a further breakdown of the percentages for each specific terpene. An example of this breakdown could look like: 2.1% Limonene, 1.5% Caryophyllene, 0.5% Terpineol, 0.4% B-Pinene. Anything above 3% total terpene content is generally considered a “high terpene cultivar” dependent on other variables. Ghost Drops’ batches of premium indoor flower have hit as high as over 5% total terpene content. High terpene cultivars generally taste, smell and hit stronger than low terpene cultivars. <\/p>",

          "content": "<br><div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h6>Ghost Guide: Cannabinoids<\/h6>\n<\/div>\n<p>We can all agree that cannabis is enjoyable and holds some therapeutic value for hundreds of thousands to millions of people across the world. The reason that cannabis is so sought-after and enjoyed is because of two chemical compounds: cannabinoids and terpenes. Both of these compounds are produced in the trichome heads (resin glands) of the cannabis plant. There are many different types of cannabinoids with two being the most prevalent. This article will outline what cannabinoids are, what the benefits of cannabinoids are and what an Endo-Cannabinoid System is.<\/p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>What are Cannabinoids?<\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>Cannabinoids are naturally occurring compounds that are found in the cannabis plant. Most studies say there are around 66 different cannabinoids in total. The most well-known and sought-after among these cannabinoids is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), which is the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. The second most prevalent cannabinoid in cannabis is Cannabidiol (or CBD), which is the chemical most associated with the health and therapeutic benefits of the plant. Cannabinoids combust or vaporize when cannabis is consumed, leading to the effects and benefits that the plant provides. <\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>What is the Endo-Cannabinoid System?<\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>Humans experience the effects and benefits of cannabis through our Endo-Cannabinoid System AKA our ECS. According to Harvard University, the ECS is responsible for regulating and controlling many of our most important bodily functions including learning and memory, emotional processing, sleep, temperature control, pain control, inflammatory and immune responses, and appetite. Your ECS is made up of a vast network of receptors and chemical signals that are densely packed throughout your brain and body. <br>\nCannabinoids bind to specific receptors found within our Endo-Cannabinoid System, which produce the benefits and effects typically associated with the cannabis plant. THC binds with CB1 and CB2 receptors. A high binding affinity of THC with CB1 receptor appears to be associated with the intensity of cannabis’ psychoactive properties. CBD has little binding affinity for either CB1 or CB2 receptors. In fact, CBD acts as a “non-competitive negative allosteric modulator” of CB1 receptor – thereby reducing the efficacy and potency of THC when consumed together. \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>The Benefits of THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol)<\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol or THC \/ Δ9-THC is the most prevalent cannabinoid found within cannabis and is responsible for producing the intoxicating high typically associated with the plant. Simply put, THC is the good stuff – it's what gets you “high”. THC is associated with a wide range of effects that may or may not be experienced by individuals who consume it. Different strains will produce varying effects and people will experience the same products in a different way based on their personal body and mental chemistry.  <br>\nTHC is typically associated with short-term effects including but not limited to: <br><br>\n•\tElation <br>\n•\tRelaxation <br>\n•\tSedation <br>\n•\tPain relief <br>\n•\tEnergy <br>\n•\tHunger <br>\n•\tIncreased heart rate <br>\n•\tDry mouth <br>\n•\tRed eyes <br>\n•\tSlowed perception of time <br>\n•\tLaughter <br>\n•\t“Couch-lock,” or feeling  heavy\n<br>\nHigh THC cultivars are highly sought-after in the Canadian legal cannabis market. Although we believe that THC percentages are not the only thing that matters (read our article on terpenes and the entourage effect here), our strains are notoriously potent. Ghost Drops First Class Funk, Z-Splitter and Khalifa Mints are known for hitting extremely high THC percentages, with batches occasionally coming in over 33-35%. \n <\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>The Benefits of CBD (Cannabidiol)  <\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>As previously mentioned, CBD is typically the second-most common cannabinoid found in cannabis cultivars. CBD is associated with a myriad of health and therapeutic benefits and effects. These benefits are supported by varying levels of evidence and are still being discovered via clinical trials. Keep in mind that these benefits are anecdotal, but here are some of the most-reported therapeutic and health effects associated with CBD:<br> <br> •\tTreating childhood epilepsy <br>\n•\tAnti-inflammatory properties <br>\n•\tAnalgesic (pain-relieving) properties <br>\n•\tMay help to relieve symptoms of depression, anxiety and addiction  <br>\n•\tAnti-inflammatory and may help with skin conditions when applied topically  <br>\n•\tRelaxation and calming  <br>\n•\tHelp promote restful sleep \n<\/p>",

Limonene is one of the most interesting and prevalent, being the second most abundant terpene across all strains. This article will outline what Limonene is, what the benefits of Limonene are, how Limonene tastes and smells and which strains Limonene is commonly found in. <\/p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>What is Limonene?<\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>Limonene is defined as a “colorless liquid aliphatic hydrocarbon classified as a cyclic monoterpene”, which essentially means that it is an aromatic chemical compound, similar to essential oils. Along with being found in a myriad of cannabis strains, limonene is the major component in the oil of citrus fruits. This oil is also found in rosemary, juniper and peppermint. Limonene is a popular additive in foods, cosmetics, cleaning products, and natural insect repellants. For example, it’s used in foods like sodas, desserts, and candies to provide a lemony flavor.<\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>Limonene in Cannabis<\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>Second to Myrcene, Limonene is one of the most common and abundant terpenes in all of cannabis. Limonene is produced within the resin glands of the cannabis plant along with other terpenes and cannabinoids. Limonene is typically associated with cannabis strains that smell strongly of lemons, however, that is not always the case so purchasing legal, lab-tested, COA-verified limonene-dominant products is the best way to ensure you’re receiving the product you are looking for. \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>What Are The Benefits of Limonene?<\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>According to WebMD, “Limonene acts as an antioxidant in the body, absorbing and removing damaging free radicals before they can injure cells. Dietary limonene may help lower your risk of certain cancers and signs of aging by reducing the amount of oxidative stress on your body.” <br>\nHealthline.com claims that Limonene may be able to reduce inflammation, have anti-cancer effects, boost heart health, reduce appetite, decrease stress and anxiety and support healthy digestion. “It is these anti-inflammatory characteristics that give limonene special value for hundreds of diseases and conditions related to inflammation, including cancer, arthritis, and asthma.”, claims Strainprint. \n <\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>What Temperature Does Limonene Vaporize At?  <\/h5>\n<\/div>\n  <p>Each terpene vaporizes at its own unique temperature. Limonene vaporizes at 176 degrees Celsius. If you use a vaporizer to consume your cannabis, set it to 176 degrees Celsius to optimally reap the benefits and taste the flavour of limonene within the limonene-dominant cultivar that you are consuming.\n <\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>What Strains Is Limonene Most Commonly Found In?  <\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>There are hundreds of different unique cultivars that contain Limonene in their terpene profiles. Some of the most common and popular Limonene-dominant strains include: <br><br> •\t<b>Durban Poison: <\/b> a pure 100% landrace Sativa strain named after the South African port city that it originated in. <br> \n•\t<b>Jack Herer:  <\/b>a sativa-dominant cultivar that has gained as much popularity as its namesake, the author and cannabis activist. <br> \n•\t<b>Sour Diesel: <\/b> an extremely popular sativa-dominant strain that produces an energizing high. <br> \n•\t<b>OG Kush: <\/b>Arguably the most popular Indica-dominant hybrid strain in the world, bred in the San Fernando Valley of California. <br> \n•\t<b>Super Lemon Haze<\/b> is an award-winning sativa strain bred by legendary breeder Green House Seeds. \n\n<\/p>",

This move helps to solidify the company as the number one premium cannabis brand in the country. <\/p>\n \n<p>Ghost Drops initially entered into the legal market by launching into British Columbia with Ontario following soon after. The company has also recently announced that they have received purchase orders from Saskatchewan.  <\/p>\n<p>\nNew Brunswick-based cannabis consumers will soon have access to Ghost Drops’ signature, award-winning strain, Z-Splitter, pre-rolled in 1g king size hemp wrap blunts. Z-Splitter is a slightly Indica-dominant hybrid with a uniquely sweet, tropical, fruity flavour and aroma. <\/p>\n <p>\nGhost Drops products will be available for purchase exclusively through the province’s official legal wholesaler – CannabisNB. There are approximately 26 brick-and-mortar stores in the province along with CannabisNB’s online delivery portal.  <\/p>\n <p>\nThe expansion continues.

When rolled, these hemp wraps produce a slow burn with thick smoke – similar to a traditional tobacco blunt (but without the tobacco). They are made with natural materials, are sustainable, eco-friendly and are considered less harmful than other blunt-type wraps.<\/p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>What is Hemp?<\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>Hemp is technically the same species as the cannabis plant but, by definition, contains very low concentrations of cannabinoids. The cannabis plant contains a more abundant amount of cannabinoids, specifically THC, the molecule responsible for the majority of the plant’s psychoactive effects. Hemp seed, hemp protein, and hemp seed oil are commonly consumed in foods. Hemp can even be used to make paper, furniture, clothing and other industrial products. <\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>The Benefits of Hemp Wrap Blunts<\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>Hemp wraps are generally a less harmful substitute when compared to traditional tobacco leaf blunts. Hemp wrap blunts taste fantastic, burn slow and smooth and produce a unique experience. Smokers receive many of the same benefits that they would through smoking a traditional blunt, but without the negative side effects and addictive potential of nicotine and tobacco. \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h5>Cannabis Blunts in Canada<\/h5>\n<\/div>\n    <p>In Canada, it is not permitted to sell tobacco and cannabis together. For this reason, every “blunt” product on the legal market is rolled with a form of hemp wrap or similar alternative. Many consumers still choose to consume old-fashioned blunts with tobacco, but these products are purchased and assembled separately. Hemp wrap blunts can be found at licensed cannabis stores across the country. Ghost Drops hemp wrap blunts can be found in Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick. \n <\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <a href=\"https:\/\/ghostdrops.com\/pages\/blunts\"><h5><span style=\"color:#ea1a77;\">Ghost Drops Hemp Wrap Blunts <\/span><\/h5><\/a>\n<\/div>\n  <p>Ghost Drops offers several hemp wrap pre-rolled options with various cultivars including First Class Funk, Z-Splitter and Khalifa Mints. Ghost Drops uses only the highest quality hemp wraps filled with premium indoor flower grown to perfection. Ghost Drops premium 1g hemp wrap blunts are available in Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick. Ghost Drops hemp wrap blunts are the most premium, highest quality blunts on the market in Canada.<\/p>",

This product release includes the return of the brand’s best-selling 14g Slimebags and the launch of two new proprietary strains, C.R.E.A.M Cake and King Sherb, in both 0.5g pre-rolled joints and 3.5g jars.  <\/p>\n<br>\n\n    <p>C.R.E.A.M Cake is a hard-hitting Indica-dominant hybrid that offers a decadent fusion of lemon, lime and cream flavours. This cross of Creamsicle x Pancakes was bred by Tiki Madman and grown exclusively by Purplefarm in the Seaway region of Eastern Ontario. “Cake Rules Everything Around Me”.  <\/p>\n\n    <p>King Sherb is a deliciously sweet hybrid strain fit for royalty. A cross of OG Kush Breath V2.1 x Blue Sherbet, King Sherb is bred by In House Genetics and grown by a talented craft micro-producer based in Quebec. An iconic strain that Ghost Drops transitioned from illicit to legal through exclusive partnerships.\n<\/p>\n\n    <p>Ghost Drops’ Slimebags offer the brand’s iconic strains in a larger, 14g format at a lower price. Slimebags only come in limited drops and typically sell out almost instantaneously from retail stores. This drop of Slimebags features the award-winning First Class Funk Indica-dominant hybrid strain. \n <\/p>\n\n  <p>These products became available for Ontario retailers through the OCS’ Flow-Through ordering portal on November 1st and will hit retail shelves the week of the 21st. This is Ghost Drops’ first product launch done exclusively through Flow-Through, the Ontario Cannabis Store’s new ordering platform.<\/p>\n<p>Flow-Through is a completely novel sales model that was hurriedly introduced to the retail space in Canada with minimal education and communication from the OCS to both retailers and LPs. There are myriad misunderstandings regarding this Flow-Through program across the industry, so the remainder of this press release will focus on explaining this new model to clear up any confusion.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/ghostdrops.com\/pages\/what-is-ocs-flow-through\">The OCS Flow-Through program<\/a> changes the way that cannabis is bought and sold between Licensed Producers and retailers. Flow-Through listings are not stocked by the OCS, but instead “flow through” their warehouse on a made-to-order, demand basis. Flow-Through orders are made by retailers through the OCS wholesale portal. <\/p>\n<p>Flow-Through products operate on a different schedule than general listing stocked deliveries. During order week, retailers place their orders between Tuesday and the following Monday on their respective order days. During week two, the OCS cuts a purchase order to the Licensed Producer based on confirmed demand from retailers. Over this time, the LP manufactures, packages and ships the ordered product to the OCS warehouse. On week three, orders are delivered to retail stores on their respective delivery dates. In total, typically 17 days elapse between the retailer’s order date and their delivery date. Retailers can order and receive Flow-Through items weekly, in the same way they order general listing stocked products. Payment terms for retailers are the same, with payment being required on production of the ASN (Advanced Shipping Notice), typically the day before orders arrive.<\/p>\n<p>There are several benefits of this program for retailers. The first is exclusive access to retailer-only drops that can’t be found through the OCS.ca, allowing stores to differentiate themselves from one another and from the government’s online product selection. Ghost Drops’ newest line-up is exclusively available through Flow-Through. Most new product launches will be done via Flow-Through by the end of 2023 according to the OCS. Through Flow-Through, inventory that is ordered is guaranteed to arrive on the retail store’s corresponding delivery date (as opposed to general listing stocked orders, which operate on a lottery system when demand exceeds supply). <\/p>\n<p>This program creates opportunities for smaller craft brands and new SKUs to get listed and prove themselves in Ontario, allowing Ghost Drops to commercialize more legacy and iconic entities under the company’s “The League” brand house. The OCS will also be accepting more SKUs and strains under this program, allowing Ghost Drops to launch a variety of new cultivars and product types in a shorter time period. This move assists LPs in more accurately gauging demand, to avoid any return-to-vendor or overproduction-related problems. <\/p>\nOverall, Ghost Drops believes that the Flow-Through program will prove beneficial for both brands and retail stores across Ontario. Additionally, consumers will have access to a wider selection of craft and premium products to choose from. Ghost Drops welcomes these necessary changes and will continue to adapt and thrive in the dynamic Canadian cannabis industry.  \n\n<p><br>Still have questions about Flow-Through?

          "content": "<br><div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h6>What is OCS Flow Through?<\/h6>\n<\/div>\n<p>The Ontario Cannabis Store has introduced a new ordering system for retailers that they call “Flow Through”. There has been confusion about this program at the retailer and LP level, so we’ve decided to help clear things up. This article will explain what the OCS Flow Through program is and how retailers can best utilize the system and schedule to their benefit. <\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h6>How does the OCS Flow-Through Process Work?<\/h6>\n<\/div>\n<p>The OCS Flow Through program changes the way that cannabis is bought and sold in the province. Flow Through listings are not stocked by the OCS, but instead “flow through” their warehouse on a made-to-order, demand basis. Flow Through orders are made through the OCS Wholesale retailer portal. <\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h6>Why did the OCS launch Flow Through? How can I use Flow Through to my benefit?<\/h6>\n<\/div>\n<p>There are several benefits of Flow Through for retailers, Licensed Producers, brands and consumers. \n<\/p>\n<strong>1. Greater Production Selection for Retailers and Consumers<\/strong>\n<p>The OCS will be accepting a wider range of SKUs under this new “Flow Through” program. That means a larger selection of more diverse products for retailers to sell to consumers. Under Flow Through, the OCS takes less risk as they only cut purchase orders for confirmed demand by retailers. This means they will be bringing in many new SKUs to the Ontario market.<\/p>\n<strong>2. More Opportunities for Craft Brands to enter Ontario<\/strong>\n<p>The OCS will be accepting more products from a larger number of brands and producers. This allows Ghost Drops to bring more illicit and iconic brands to the legal market under our The League strategy.<\/p>\n\n <strong>3. Retail Store Differentiation <\/strong>\n <p>This change allows retail stores to stock a wider variety of products that will not be available to consumers through the OCS.ca online portal. This allows stores to begin to differentiate from both the provincial wholesaler and other competing retailers. <\/p>\n\n <strong> 4. Guaranteed Inventory  <\/strong>\n <p>With general listing products, every stocked item is on a “lottery system”. This means that if demand exceeds supply, some stores will receive a lower quantity (or none) of the product they ordered. With Flow Through, ordered inventory is guaranteed to arrive at the retail store as long as the Licensed Producer fulfills its shipping obligations. This allows stores to more accurately plan their inventory.<\/p>\n\n  <strong>5. Ghost Drops Newest Line-up <\/strong>\n <p>Ghost Drops’ newest line-up, including our C.R.E.A.M Cake and King Sherb strains, are available to Ontario retailers exclusively via Flow Through. We will be dropping a ton of new cultivars and product types on this portal in the coming months. <\/p>\n\n <div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h6>How long do OCS Flow Through orders take to arrive?<\/h6>\n<\/div>\n<p>Retailers are able to order product on their regularly scheduled ordering dates. Generally, there is a 17-day time period between the order day and the date of delivery at the retail store.\nWe suggest that retail stores place weekly Flow Through orders so that they begin to receive Flow Through orders on a weekly basis. Flow Through orders generally arrive with a retailer’s regularly scheduled general listing orders.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h6>OCS Flow Through Weekly Schedule<\/h6>\n<\/div>\n<strong>1. Order Week: Tuesday to Monday retailers order product via Flow Through.<\/strong><br>\n<strong>2. Manufacture Week: Tuesday to Monday the OCS cuts purchase orders and LPs manufacture, package and ship product to the OCS warehouse.<\/strong> <br>\n<strong>3. Delivery Week: OCS ships product and retailers receive on allotted delivery date. <\/strong>\n\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h6>When do I have to pay for my Flow Through order as a retailer? <\/h6>\n<\/div>\n<p>Flow Through payment terms are essentially identical to payment terms for general listing stocked product orders. Payment is due upon the generation of the ASN (Advanced Shipping Notice), which is typically sent to the retailer the day before products are delivered. As a retailer, your money is NOT tied up for longer under Flow Through. There should be no concerns as it pertains to inventory and cash management for this reason. Retailers simply pay the day before their order arrives and can cancel their delivery between the time the order is placed and the ASN is generated.  <\/p>\n<div class=\"para-text\"> \n      <h6>The Future of Flow Through  <\/h6>\n<\/div>\n<p>This new Flow Through program sets the stage for more direct relationships and communications between brands and retailers. The Canadian cannabis industry will continue to evolve as time goes on. Ghost Drops will continue to adapt to fulfill our mission of bringing the very best cannabis to consumers across the country.  <\/p>\n<br>\n<p>Still have questions about Flow Through? <\/p>\n\n<p>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:sales@ghostdrops.com\">sales@ghostdrops.com<\/a> with any questions or concerns!<\/p>",

This strain is exclusively grown for Ghost Drops by Purplefarm Genetics, making it a prized find for Canadian cannabis enthusiasts. Baklava is a heavy hitter and it is known for its potent and flavorful smoke. <\/p>\n\n<p>One of the most striking features of Baklava is its appearance. The buds are dense and tight, with a dark green color that is accented by an abundance of pistils and trichomes. These trichomes give the buds a frosty, almost glittery appearance, making them quite visually appealing. The buds are extremely sticky and hard to break apart by hand, so it's best to use a grinder.\n<\/p>\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0607\/7104\/1503\/files\/013293_baklava_purplefarmgenetics_downsized_17998d6d-9c69-4788-b994-5afe4310b9a7.jpg?v=1675962996\">\n<br><br>\n<p>The aroma of Baklava is also quite unique, with an earthy, gassy scent that is accented by notes of sweet vanilla and cream.

Notice notes of slight citrus and earth and a bit of diesel on the back end. When the buds are grinded up, the strain produces more of a gassy and creamy aroma, with the diesel and vanilla notes taking over.\n <\/p>\n <p>\nWhen it comes to taste, Baklava does not disappoint. The strain offers a sweet, citrusy fruit flavour on the inhale, with hints of diesel and spice on the exhale. The vanilla baked goods aromas translate to a buttery sweet taste reminiscent of an apple turnover or an almond croissant. This combination of flavours makes for a well-rounded smoke that is both enjoyable and satisfying. The Indica-dominant hybrid cross of Kosher Kush and Gelato 41 is as potent as it is flavorful, making it a favorite amongst cannabis enthusiasts. The smoke is smooth and creamy, with a noticeable aftertaste.\n<\/p>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0607\/7104\/1503\/files\/013289_baklava_purplefarmgenetics_downsized.jpg?v=1675961126\"> \n<br><br>\n<p>In terms of its cultivation, Baklava is suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.
